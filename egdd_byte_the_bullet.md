# Byte the Bullet

## Elevator Pitch

Byte the Bullet is a rogue-like dungeon crawler that combines fast-paced combat with hands-on coding challenges. Players fight through glitched-out levels, debug broken code, and solve algorithmic puzzles to repair the world and defeat corrupted bosses and enemies.

## Influences (Brief)

- *Influence #1*:
  - Enter The Gungeon
  - Explanation: This game is one of the definitive top down shooter + dungeon crawler games, and the gameplay of Byte the Bullet will be similar in the sense that it is a top down shooter + dungeon crawler.
- *Influence #2*:
  - LeetCode
  - Explanation: The hands-on coding challenges in the game are similar to the coding challenges from the website LeetCode.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Top-down combat - The player will view their character from a top-down camera angle and will need to shoot enemies and dodge bullets in order to survive.
- Debugging Glitched Rooms - some of the rooms you encounter will feature glitched code that the player will have to debug to enter.
- Leetcode chests - There will be chests in the game with powerful items inside, but they may only be opened after solving a coding problem.
- Stack-based inverntory - 
- Algorithm-based weapons - 
- Difficulty Selection - There will be different difficulties selectable that will make the coding challenges easier or more difficult.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Debugging code and solving coding problems at different levels.

## Target Audiences

- Beginner coders who want to enhance their coding and debugging skills
- Experienced coders who want to strengthen their coding and debugging ability.

## Target Contexts

This would be used as a for-fun activity for students who want to get better at coding on their own time. Due to its use of weapons, it would be limited to high school students and above.

## Learning Objectives

- By playing this game, players will be able to identify and fix syntax errors in code snippets, and develop problem-solving and debugging skills.
- By playing this game, players will be able to solve simple algorithmic problems.
- By playing this game, players will be able to use data structure concepts more effectively when coding.

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*
